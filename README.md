# Computational Bio Tools

### This is a compilation of computational tools to enhance the analysis technqiues of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. 
#### All scripts written in python3


### List of tools
======

1. Fingerprinting analysis - works with csv output from Schrodinger-Maestro (versions 2020 or earlier; analysis script for newer versions coming soon)
2. Fingerprinting/interaction analysis python script - does not require Schrodinger output!
3. Reverse Docking with GNINA
4. RCSB Webscrapper - requires a text document with a list of UniProt IDs. 
5. Cluster splitter - split cluster file outputs from GROMACS into individual files
6. Interaction pairs between two sets of residue ranges from Molecular Dynamics Simulations (works with xtc files) (coming soon)
7. Angle claculations for Molecular Dynamics Simulations - analyze angle changes between two sets of residue ranges (works with xtc files) (coming soon)
8. Machine Learning with Linear Regression Classification example using interacting pairs and angle between two protein domains (coming soon)
9. PyMOL scripts for best practices in protein visualization
