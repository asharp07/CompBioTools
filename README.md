# Computatioanl Bio Tools

### This is a compilation of computational tools I have written to enhance the analysis technqiues of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. 
#### All scripts written in python3


### List of tools
======

1. Fingerprinting analysis - works with csv output from Schrodinger-Maestro (versions 2020 or earlier; analysis script for newer versions coming soon)
2. Interaction pairs between two sets of residue ranges from Molecular Dynamics Simulations (works with xtc files)
3. Cluster splitter - split cluster file outputs from GROMACS into individual files
4. Angle claculations for Molecular Dynamics Simulations - analyze angle changes between two sets of residue ranges (works with xtc files)
